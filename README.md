# Week13-HW11-FriendFinder

It's Week13, Homework #11.
The requirement is to create a app with front end abd a node.js backend http server to serve HTML pages and handle api requests.

The data are stored in an array for this homework as required.

The html pages use forms and modal.

The demo uses bootstrap but I use html/css combination only to create similar look and feels. Because the demo uses bootstrap so extensively that it's hard not to copy its html/bootstrap code in order to create similar look. I tried materialze framework but it's hard to work with modal code.
