# Week13-HW11-FriendFinder

It's Week13, Homework #11.
The requirement is to create an app with frontend pages and a node.js backend http server to serve HTML pages and handle api requests.

The data are stored in an array for this homework as required.

The survey page uses forms to collect data and modal to show result.

I use html/css combination only to create similar look and feel to the demo. 

The questions in the survey are copied from https://www.16personalities.com
