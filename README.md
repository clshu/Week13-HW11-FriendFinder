# Week13-HW11-FriendFinder

It's Week13, Homework #11.
The requirement is to create an app with frontend pages and a node.js backend http server to serve HTML pages and handle api requests.

The data are stored in an array for this homework as required.

The survey page uses forms to collect data and modal to show result.

The demo uses bootstrap but I use html/css combination only to create similar look and feels. Because the demo uses bootstrap so extensively that it's hard not to copy its html/bootstrap code in order to create similar look. I tried materialze framework but it's hard to work with modal code.

The questions in the survey are copied from https://www.16personalities.com
